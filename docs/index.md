# Welcome to Meadowrun's documentation!

Meadowrun automates the tedious details of running your python code on AWS. Meadowrun
will

- choose the optimal set of EC2 on-demand or spot instances and turn them off when
  they're no longer needed
- deploy your code and libraries to the EC2 instances, so you don't have to worry about
  creating packages and building Docker images
- scale from a single function to thousands of parallel tasks

For more context, see the [project homepage](https://meadowrun.io).
