# This is meant to turn a pip requirements.txt file into a container. To be used like:
# docker build -t image_name:tag --build-arg ENV_FILE=requirements.txt --build-arg PYTHON_VERSION=3.10 -f src/meadowrun/docker_files/PipDockerfile .
# This assumes that ./requirements.txt exists and defines the environment

ARG ENV_FILE

# TODO ideally we would host pre-built versions on DockerHub that already have git
# installed
RUN apt update; apt install -y git
