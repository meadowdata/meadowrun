  Text](https://betterprogramming.pub/using-aws-and-hyperscan-to-match-regular-expressions-on-100gb-of-text-4d87a62141ee)
  Uses Meadowrun's `run_map` to process a (relatively) large dataset.
- [Run Your Own DALLÂ·E Mini (Craiyon) Server on
  EC2](https://medium.com/@meadowrun/run-your-own-dall-e-mini-craiyon-server-on-ec2-e8aef6f974c1)
  Uses Meadowrun's support for specifying GPU instances to do inference quickly with large
  ML models.
