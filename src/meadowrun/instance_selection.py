    remaining_resources_sort_key indicates how "good" it is to run the job on that agent
    based on how many resources would be left if we created a worker for that job on
    that agent. The general idea is that having fewer resources left is better. E.g. if
    you have agent1 with 8GB+4cpu and agent2 with 2GB+1cpu, and you have a job that
    requires 2GB+1cpu, it's probably better to run it on agent2--that way if another job
    comes along that requires 8GB+4cpu, agent1 is still available to run that job. I.e.
    we prefer to create workers on agents that have a smaller
    remaining_resources_sort_key.

    indicator is either 0 or 1--0 means that it is possible to run the job on this
    agent, whereas 1 means that there are not enough resources to run the job on this
    agent. (We use the indicator this way because smaller is better for the
    remaining_resources_sort_key, so 0 is good and 1 is bad.)

    TODO we should probably be more thoughtful about the exact implementation of
     remaining_resources_sort_key.

     along. E.g. if we have many low-priority jobs that require 1 CPU, and then a
     high-priority job requiring 16 CPUs comes along we might wish that we had not used
     all of our resources to run the low-priority jobs. On the other hand, if you
