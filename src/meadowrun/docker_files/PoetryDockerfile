# - curl/wget isn't available, but we can just use python
# - TODO ideally we (or someone) would pre-build a bunch of versions python with poetry already installed
# - When we actually run jobs, we will copy code for those jobs into paths like
#   /meadowrun/code0 and we'll want to run with the working directory as one of those
#   directories. But we're putting the pyproject.toml/project.lock files in /tmp and
#   poetry doesn't natively support running from a different working directory. Setting
#   virtualenvs.in-project means that poetry will create the virtual env in /tmp/.venv
#   and we'll just add this to our path. We could switch to using `poetry run` if
#   something like https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry/issues/2179 gets implemented
